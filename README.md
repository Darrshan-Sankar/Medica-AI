# Media AI

Media AI is an innovative application designed to diagnose diseases in brain, eyes, and lungs scan inputs using deep learning algorithms trained on medical imaging datasets. Additionally, it aims to create an OpenMRS (Open Medical Record System) to track patient diseases and analyze disease trends.

## üåü General Info

### Currently available for: Brain, Eyes, and Lungs
### üß† Brain Diseases Classification
The brain diseases classification in Media AI includes the following categories:

- Glioma
- Benign Tumor
- Normal (Non-affected)

### üëÄ Eye Diseases Classification
Media AI can classify the following eye diseases:

- Normal
- Cataract
- Glaucoma
- Diabetic Retinopathy

### ü´Å Lung Diseases Classification
The lung diseases classification covers the following conditions:

- Bacterial Pneumonia
- Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19)
- Normal
- Tuberculosis
- Viral Pneumonia

### üìä Dataset Details

Media AI relies on curated medical imaging datasets to train its machine learning models. Here are the details of the datasets used:

#### Eyes Dataset
- Contains images of eyes with classes including Normal, Cataract, Glaucoma, and Diabetic Retinopathy.
- [Eyes Diseases Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunavenkatdoddi/eye-diseases-classification)

#### Lungs Dataset
- Contains images of lungs with classes including Bacterial Pneumonia, Corona Virus Disease, Normal, Tuberculosis, and Viral Pneumonia.
- [Lungs Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkarmanohardalvi/lungs-disease-dataset-4-types)

#### Brain Dataset
- Contains images of brain scans with classes including Glioma, Benign Tumor, and Normal.
- [Multi Cancer Brain MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdrabbaniuvce/multi-cancer)
- Additional Normal Brain MRI Images: [Brain MRI Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/babaraliuser/brain-mri-images-dataset)

#### üöÄ Motivation
The motivation behind the Media AI project is to leverage machine learning and image processing techniques to enhance medical diagnostics. By automating disease detection processes, Media AI aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of diagnoses, leading to better patient outcomes.

### üéØ OpenMRS Implementation
In addition to disease diagnosis, Media AI implements an OpenMRS system to store patient diseases data. This enables healthcare providers to track patient health records, analyze disease trends, and make informed decisions regarding treatment and resource allocation.

### üß† Why Media AI?
Media AI stands out for its ability to accurately diagnose diseases using advanced machine learning techniques. By automating the diagnosis process and implementing an OpenMRS system, Media AI offers a comprehensive solution for healthcare providers to improve patient care and optimize healthcare management.

#### ‚ö° Challenges
Developing Media AI poses challenges such as dataset collection, model training, and system integration. However, overcoming these challenges will lead to a powerful tool for medical diagnostics and healthcare management.
